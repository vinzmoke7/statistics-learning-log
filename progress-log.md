# Progress Log

## Day 1
Topic:
- Dot plots
- Clusters
- Gaps
- Outliers

Source:
- Khan Academy (Statistics & Probability)

What I learned:
- Clusters are about closeness, not quantity
- Gaps show missing ranges in data

Note:
Khan Academy course page still shows Unit 1 as not started,

## Day 2
Topic:
- Individuals and variables
- Categorical variables
- Pictograms

Source:
- Khan Academy (Statistics & Probability)

Note:
Progress was light due to exam preparation.

but individual statistics skills (dot plots, clusters, outliers)
show completed progress via search.
