# Progress Log

## Day 1
Topic:
- Dot plots
- Clusters
- Gaps
- Outliers

Source:
- Khan Academy (Statistics & Probability)

What I learned:
- Clusters are about closeness, not quantity
- Gaps show missing ranges in data


## Day 2
Topic:
- Individuals and variables
- Categorical variables
- Pictograms

Note:
Progress was light due to exam preparation.

but individual statistics skills (dot plots, clusters, outliers)
show completed progress via search.


Next:
- Shape of distributions

## Topic: Bar Charts

### 📌 Definition
A **bar chart** is a graphical representation used to display **categorical data**.

Each category is represented by a separate bar.
The height of each bar represents the **frequency (count)** of that category.

Bars do **not touch** because the data is categorical (distinct groups).

### 🧠 When to Use a Bar Chart

Use a bar chart when:
- The variable is **categorical**
- You want to compare counts between categories

Examples of categorical variables:
- Gender
- Department
- Favorite programming language
- Yes/No responses

Do NOT use a bar chart for continuous numerical data.

### 🏗 Structure of a Bar Chart

- X-axis → Categories
- Y-axis → Frequency (Count)
- Bars are separated
- Categories can be rearranged

### 📊 Example

Survey: Favorite Programming Language (40 students)

| Language | Frequency |
|----------|-----------|
| Python   | 18        |
| Java     | 10        |
| C++      | 7         |
| Others   | 5         |

Interpretation:
- Python is the most preferred language.
- Others is the least preferred.

### ✅ What I Learned

After studying bar charts, I can:

- Identify categorical variables in a dataset
- Choose the correct graph for categorical data
- Interpret frequency comparisons
- Distinguish between a bar chart and a histogram
