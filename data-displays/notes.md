# Data Displays – Beginner Notes

## Dot Plots
A dot plot shows each data value as a dot on a number line.

## Cluster
A cluster is a group of data points that are close together.

## Gap
A gap is a range on the number line where no data points appear.

## Outlier
An outlier is a value that is far away from most of the data.

## My confusion
Sometimes I mistake a cluster for just "many dots" instead of closeness.
