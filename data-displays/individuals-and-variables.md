# Individuals, Variables, and Pictograms

## Individuals
Individuals are the objects or people being studied in a data set.

Example:
If we record the favorite food of students in a class,
the individuals are the students.

## Variables
A variable is a characteristic measured or observed for each individual.

Example:
Favorite food, height, or age of a student.

## Categorical Variables
Categorical variables describe qualities or categories, not numbers.

Examples:
- Favorite food
- Gender
- Blood group

These variables group individuals into categories.

## Pictograms
A pictogram is a chart that uses pictures or symbols to represent data.

Example:
If one picture represents 5 students,
then 3 pictures represent 15 students.

## What I found easy
Identifying individuals once the data context is clear.

## What confused me
Sometimes I confuse the variable with the individual.
