# Worked Examples – Data Displays

## Example 1: Identifying clusters and outliers

Given data:
2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 20

Step 1: Plot on a number line (conceptually)
Most values fall between 2 and 7.

Step 2: Identify clusters
The values from 2 to 7 form a cluster because they are close together.

Step 3: Identify gaps
There is a large gap between 7 and 20 where no data points appear.

Step 4: Identify outliers
The value 20 is far away from the cluster and is an outlier.

Conclusion:
The main cluster is between 2 and 7, and 20 is an outlier.
